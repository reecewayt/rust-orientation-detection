# Embedded Rust Orientation Detection Application
**Author:** Reece Wayt (reecwayt@pdx.edu)  
**GitHub Repo URL:** https://github.com/reecewayt/rust-orientation-detection  
**Description:** This project uses the **BBC Microbit V2** which is a SBC with a Nordic nRF52833 processor, on board sensors, leds, buttons, a speaker, and debugger. More specifically, this project will utilize the on-board accelerometer (ST LSM303AGR) to perform orientation sensing. Orientation detection is a very popular and ubiquitously used in satelites, air crafts, VR, and mobile phones. The LSM303AGR has a wide host of features and below are the specific ones I plan to utilize in my implmentation.

## Project Features
1. 6D Orientation Detection
    - My application will detect orientation in a 3 dimensional vector space which can be represented as a column or row vector as shown below. Note that these are signed values. 
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 
X \\ Y \\ Z
\end{bmatrix},
[X \; Y \; Z]
$$
2. Low power functionality after inactivity
    - The accelerometer includes functionality to enter into low power mode after inactivity. Low power is very essential for embedded applications so I plan to implement this in my final application by configuring the sensor to enter into low power. 
    - With this functionality, I will need to also configure the sensor to activate after a given acceleration threshold has been reached. Once reached the device will wake up and enter full performance mode. 

3. Sensor interfacing will be over I2C Bus
    - The SBC is wired such that the Microbit is connect to this sensor via the I2C serial bus. 

## Software Requirements
1. Development Environment
- Rust toolchain
- `cargo-embed` or `probe-run` for flashing
- ARM GCC toolchain
- `rust-analyzer` for VS Code support
2. Required Crates (as listed in `Cargo.toml`)
- `microbit-v2`: Hardware abstraction for Micro:bit V2
- `cortex-m` and `cortex-m-rt`: Core ARM support
- `lsm303agr`: Accelerometer driver

## Project Milestones
1. Environment Setup
2. Sensor Communication
- Establish I2C communication with LSM303AGR
- Read basic acceleration values
3. Orientation Detection
- Implement orientation detection (Vector Math)
- Create visual feedback by printing human readable values over UART (Virtual Com Port)
- Test all possible orientations
3. Power Management
- Implement low power mode after inactivity configuration
- Configure wake-up threshold
- Test power state transitions
4. Turn in project and finalize documenation

## Testing Strategy
Rust does not have a unit testing framework for embedded systems, at least not in the sense of the traditional `#[cfg(test)]` attribute. With that said, I'll be utilizing debuggers and conditional compilation to verify code on the host machine as described below. 
1. Debugging
- Utilize VS Code's integrated debugger with custom `launch.json` configurations for JLink connections with Microbit
- RTT (Real-Time Transfer) for debug and error logging at runtime
- Logic Analyzer for reading I2C transactions
2. Conditional Compilation Traits
- Use attributes to enable debug features only in development builds
```rust
// Only compiles in debug builds
#[cfg(debug)]
print_info(some_info); 

// Also include assertions in debug builds
#[cfg(feature = "assertions")]
assert_equal(x, y); 
```

## Challenges 
- Low power mode testing will be difficult and hard to verify especially since the power traces on the board are covered by a silk screen
- I might need to implement interrupt mechanisms 
- Depending on the sensor and the stress its been under since manufacturing, I will need to consider error and offset of sensor data.
